Task1: Find password in Crackme using Radare2

1. Compile crackme source code to achieve a.out executable
For examlple, 
	clang main.c
or
	gcc main.c

or download prebuild a.out binary using wget and make it executable
	wget https://sonified.vision/a.out
	chmod +x a.out

2. Create folder
	mkdir disasm && cd disasm

3. Clone and install disassembler
	git clone https://github.com/radareorg/radare2
	radare2/sys/user.sh

4. Launch crackme
	./a.out

5. Intup any password and remember the output
	Enter password 123 

6. Open crackme in disassembler
	radare2/binr/radare2/radare2 

7. Look for outputted strings
	iz | grep Wrong
	aa
	axt 0x00000877

8. Investigate the usage of outputted strings
	s main
	pd 25
	s str.p_sSw0rd
	px

9. You will have the required password in plaintext

10. Relaunch a.out and input password found in disassembler

11. If you see "Success" message, then you completely solved this task.
